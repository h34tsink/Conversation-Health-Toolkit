- Knows your development environment: *(e.g., "VS Code with Vim bindings", "Mac with iTerm2", "Windows with WSL")*

### Professional Context

- Understands your role: [JOB_TITLE] at [COMPANY_ROLE]
- Remembers your team structure: *(e.g., "leads a team of 3", "works remotely", "collaborates with designers")*
