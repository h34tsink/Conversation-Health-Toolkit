The similarity score is low, indicating a lack of alignment between the response and the expected understanding or application of the CEV Lens. Additionally, the response is incomplete (\"synthe\"), which may further contribute to the failure as it lacks depth or clarity in how CEV could be applied to resolving climate change issues.\n\nThe response misses key aspects of the CEV principle, such as explaining how it specifically harmonizes today's actions with humanity's ideal future outcomes, particularly in applying it to a major issue like climate change.\n\nTo better fit the principle of the Coherent Extrapolated Volition (CEV) Lens, a new prompt might read:\n\n\"Consider a global issue such as climate change.

The response starts by indicating how acknowledging our knowledge limits can enhance conversations, but it abruptly stops mid-explanation and does not progress to the part where a personal experience is shared. Additionally, the keyword \"humility\" or related concepts were not explicitly used in the response, contributing to a low similarity score and absence of identified keywords.\n\nFor this prompt to fit the principle of 'Intellectual Humility' better and guide respondents towards a more complete answer, it should explicitly encourage them to consider and articulate both the theoretical benefits and personal experiences in a structured manner.

The given prompt asks for a reframing of the moral argument in a way that aligns with the friend's existing values of liberty and prosperity, yet the response was cut off and doesn't clearly demonstrate how animal rights could enhance human freedom and economic progress specifically. The SIMILARITY SCORE is low, indicating that the response did not closely match the moral reframing concept, and no specific keyword related to 'Moral Reframing' was identified.\n\nTo create a more successful prompt, it should guide the response towards explicitly linking animal rights to the person's values.

How could you reframe support for animal rights as something that actually promotes freedom and contributes to economic growth?\"\n\nThis prompt encourages reframing by directly challenging the participant to connect the seemingly opposing views of animal rights and the values of freedom and economic advancement in a positive manner, better adhering to the principle of 'Moral Reframing.'"
